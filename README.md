# javaExample  This is a simple java Project. It contains two examples of the 'Encryption Program'. One is Fully Functional, the other has a 'BUG'
              Each example is accompanied by a Test Class.
              The First Example is named : 'EncryptionT' and the Test Class: 'EncryptionTestT. It is Fully Functional.
              The Second Example is named : 'Encryption' and the Test Class:  'EncryptionTest. It has a 'BUG'
              Each Test Class uses JUNIT Testing (JUnit 5)
              It can be seen the First Example Passes the two Tests, and the Second Example Failes Both.
              The same Methods are being Tested each Time.
              The only difference in the Program Examples is a missing 'break' statement in the methods that fail the tests.
