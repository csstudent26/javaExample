# javaExample

This is a simple Java project that contains two examples of the 'Encryption Program'. One example is fully functional, while the other has a bug.

## Examples and Test Classes

- First Example:
  - Name: 'EncryptionT'
  - Test Class: 'EncryptionTestT'
  - Status: Fully Functional

- Second Example:
  - Name: 'Encryption'
  - Test Class: 'EncryptionTest'
  - Status: Contains a bug

Both examples use JUnit testing (JUnit 5). It can be observed that the first example passes both tests, while the second example fails both tests. The same methods are being tested in both examples. The only difference between the program examples is a missing 'break' statement in the methods that fail the tests.
